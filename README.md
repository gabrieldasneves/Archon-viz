## Context:

Web services are getting more popular, generating lots of hierarchical data in JSON or XML formats. But many people still use tabular files like Excel and CSV. Visualizing and understanding the hierarchy in these formats can be tough, often needing programming skills. To help users manage hierarchical data in tabular formats, we've developed a web-based tool. It lets users load, manipulate, and understand hierarchical data from tables. Built with web technologies and data visualization principles, the tool uses a radial tree to display data. We demonstrate its features with a case study on skin cancer images, allowing users to explore different hierarchies and export data in JSON or keep it in tabular form.

## Objective:

This work was inspired by [Chang's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0efD_p_E3s) project that proposes an approach to deal with hierarchies directly in spreadsheet format. However, Chang's work does not create any kind of visualization and the visual representation of data can be essential to generate insights about the dataset

This project aims to meet the following requirements related to the problem to be solved:
* Requirement 1: The data explored by the application is of low volume and is in an input file in tabular format (ex.: .csv) provided by the user;
* Requirement 2: The application must allow users to modify hierarchically structured data values as well as reorganize the hierarchy of these data;
* Requirement 3: The user does not need to have programming skills;
* Requirement 4: The application must allow exporting the modified data in .csv or .json formats;
* Requisito 5: Data must be represented in a visual way, making it easier to understand the data hierarchy.



### the Data sample

The data we used as sample are obtained from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC, 2021). The set used is a subset of dermoscopic images of skin lesions constituted for 232 items, a small amount but enough to simulate an image library built by a doctor from his patients.

## Hands on!
