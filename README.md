# Archon-vis (my bachelor's degree final project)

## Abstract:

Due to its large applicability, web services have been gaining more popularity. This means that more hierarchical data are generated with hierarchical, mainly in JSON or XML formatted files. However, many users still use tabular files, such as Excel spreadsheets and CSV files. Without a specific tool, visualizing and understanding fully the hierarchy surrounding the data becomes a hard task, sometimes requiring programming skills. In order to support the users leading with hierarchical data in tabular format, in this work, we present a web-based tool that allows users to load, manipulate and understand hierarchical data from tabular data. The tool was developed using web technologies and data visualization principles to represent hierarchical data through a radial tree. The tool and its functionalities are demonstrated through a case study of skin cancer images, where users can investigate different hierarchies, manipulate and export data in JSON format or keep them as tabular data.

## Objective:

This work was inspired by Chang's project that proposes an approach to deal with hierarchies directly in spreadsheet format. However, [Chang's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0efD_p_E3s) work does not create any kind of visualization and the visual representation of data can be essential to generate insights about the dataset

This project aims to meet the following requirements related to the problem to be solved:
* Requirement 1: The data explored by the application is of low volume and is in an input file in tabular format (ex.: .csv) provided by the user;
* Requirement 2: The application must allow users to modify hierarchically structured data values as well as reorganize the hierarchy of these data;
* Requirement 3: The user does not need to have programming skills;
* Requirement 4: The application must allow exporting the modified data in .csv or .json formats;
* Requisito 5: Os dados devem ser representados de forma visual, facilitando a compreens√£o da hierarquia dos dados.
