Abstract

Due to its large applicability, web services have been gaining more popularity. This means that more hierarchical data are generated with hierarchical, mainly in JSON or XML formatted files. However, many users still use tabular files, such as Excel spreadsheets and CSV files. Without a specific tool, visualizing and understanding fully the hierarchy surrounding the data becomes a hard task, sometimes requiring programming skills. In order to support the users leading with hierarchical data in tabular format, in this work, we present a web-based tool that allows users to load, manipulate and understand hierarchical data from tabular data. The tool was developed using web technologies and data visualization principles to represent hierarchical data through a radial tree. By using the proposed tool, users can investigare different hierarchies, manipulate and export data in JSON format ou keep them as tabular data.
